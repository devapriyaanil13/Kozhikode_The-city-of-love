            <h2>Where Buying Feels Personal</h2>
            <p>Kozhikode never asks you to hurry or keep up with time. Its places wait patiently for you to arrive
                slowly, to sit without checking the clock, and to look around without needing a plan. From quiet
                beaches where the sea softens your thoughts to everyday streets filled with familiar faces, each
                place holds moments people return to — not because they are famous or grand, but because they feel
                right and comforting. This city is not about ticking off locations or rushing through attractions.
                It invites you to pause, notice small details, and experience life as it unfolds around you. In
                Kozhikode, presence matters more than movement, and the journey feels meaningful simply because you
                allowed yourself to slow down and be there.</p>

                    <h2>📍 SM Street</h2>
                    <p>This is where shopping begins for most people, whether they plan it or not. SM Street is always
                        moving — shops close together, voices overlapping, smells of food drifting in between. You’ll
                        find
                        clothing, footwear, snacks, sweets, and small everyday items, all side by side. Even if you
                        don’t
                        buy much, the walk itself feels like part of the experience.</p>

                    <h2>📍 Mittai Theruvu & Surrounding Lanes</h2>
                    <p>Just beyond the main stretches, these lanes hold shops that locals trust deeply. Fabrics,
                        household items, and traditional goods are sold without flash or noise. Shopkeepers explain
                        patiently and give you space to decide. Prices feel fair, and nothing feels forced. This area
                        reminds you that shopping doesn’t need spectacle to feel satisfying or meaningful.</p>

                    <h2>📍 Gujarati Street</h2>
                    <p>Gujarati Street feels calmer, quieter, and more focused. Known mainly for jewellery and
                        traditional shops, this street has a steady rhythm that doesn’t change much with time. People
                        walk slowly, shops feel organised, and conversations happen softly. Shopping here feels
                        intentional rather than impulsive. It’s a place you come to when you know what you want and want
                        to choose it carefully.</p>

                    <h2>📍Beypore Market Area</h2>
                    <p>Shopping around Beypore feels slower and grounded in everyday life. Close to the harbour, shops
                        here sell essentials and items shaped by coastal routines. There’s no attempt to impress, only
                        to serve what people genuinely need. Walking through this area feels calm and honest, showing
                        how closely trade and daily living are connected in Kozhikode.</p>

                    <h2>📍Palayam Market</h2>
                    <p>Palayam is practical, busy, and deeply local. This area is known for everyday shopping —
                        vegetables, groceries, small household items, and quick purchases that people make without
                        thinking twice. Shops open early, conversations are short but friendly, and everything feels
                        efficient without being stressful. Shopping here feels like watching daily life move smoothly.

                    <h2>📍Beach Road Stretch</h2>
                    <p>Shopping near the beach feels casual and unplanned. Small stalls, local sellers, and simple shops
                        appear alongside evening walks. People browse while talking, snacking, or watching the sea. You
                        don’t come here with a list — you come here to wander, and sometimes that’s enough.</p>

                    <p>Mavoor Road feels more modern but still rooted. Lined with showrooms, clothing stores, electronics shops, and cafes, it blends shopping with movement. People come here knowing what they want, but still take their time browsing. It’s a good balance between convenience and comfort, where shopping fits naturally into the flow of the city.</p>
